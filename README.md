Ryan Durnan Lab4 Submission

This lab involved modifying existing code files to test vector functions from
the standard template library. Additionally, I had to create the following new 
functions:

1. A function that adds ten random numbers to a vector
2. A function that prints all the values in a vector at even indexes
3. A function that determines whether or not a value is in a vector

To remind myself about the push_back() function for vectors, I used the following:

To put random values into the vector, I used the rand() function as described in the following:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/

To figure out the implementation of the sort() function, I used the following:
